## SmartyzeDetect API Server

SmartyzeDetect provides simplified APIs for AI solutions like Intrusion Detection, Line-cross Detection (Tripwire), Social Distancing Detection and Mask Detection. The APIs are deployable as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container instance on compatible machines and the APIs are exposed via a [thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) API server on the instance.

This repository contains a basic user guide for anyone wishing to try out the APIs for themselves. It currently contains:
  - A high level conceptual overview of the API
  - The thrift API specification and associated documentation
  - A deployment guide demonstrating how to spin up a API server container instance on AWS ECS
  - Demo scripts which invoke the API as examples for usage

The Docker image is hosted on Amazon ECR Public at [link](https://gallery.ecr.aws/j6h6k0h7/ml/sd-apiserver)
