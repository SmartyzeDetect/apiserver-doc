## SmartyzeDetect API Server

SmartyzeDetect provides simplified APIs for AI-based solutions like ANPR/ALPR, Intrusion Detection, Line-cross Detection (Tripwire), Social Distancing Detection and Mask Detection. The API is deployable as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container and accessible via either a REST or [thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) RPC interface.

This repository contains a basic user guide for anyone wishing to try out the APIs for themselves. It currently contains:
  - A high level conceptual overview of the API
  - The API specification and associated documentation
  - A deployment guide demonstrating how to spin up a API server container instance on AWS ECS or locally
  - Demo scripts which invoke the API as examples for usage

The Docker image is hosted on Amazon ECR Public at [link](https://gallery.ecr.aws/smartyzedetect/ml/sd-apiserver)
